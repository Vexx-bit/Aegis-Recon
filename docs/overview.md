# AEGIS RECON
**AI-Powered Cyber Defense and Reconnaissance Platform**

---

## 🔰 Vision

Aegis Recon is a unified cybersecurity intelligence platform that leverages **AI and automation** to perform deep reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, and smart reporting for developers, students, and enterprises.  

Our vision is to empower Kenya’s digital infrastructure and youth-driven innovation through **responsible AI for national cyber resilience**.

---

## 💡 Background

Current cybersecurity tools such as **Nmap**, **Nikto**, and **Sublist3r** are powerful but scattered, technical, and time-consuming to interpret. Many analysts, students, and small organizations lack the skills to turn raw scan data into meaningful insights.

**Aegis Recon** solves this by integrating these open-source tools into a single web-based interface enhanced with **AI-driven summaries, visual analytics, and predictive defense recommendations.**

---

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Automate network reconnaissance using trusted open-source tools.
2. Use AI to summarize and explain complex scan data in plain language.
3. Provide an intuitive dashboard for data visualization and reports.
4. Support ethical hacking education and research through a controlled environment.
5. Introduce subscription-based models for premium scans and AI insights.
